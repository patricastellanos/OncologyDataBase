This week we expected to be able to do...
Start working with java

Optional: Reasons why
We saw how to write from SQL to java

This week we did...
Create the pojos and start with DBManager 

Optional: Reasons why
We already have the tables, ER diagram and SQL code for tables creation and learnt how to write that in java

Next weeks we will do...
Continue with the java code for DBManager methods 

Optional: Reasons why
More time to work in class and more information
